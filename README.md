# Summer-Coding-Workshop
As part of Learning Ally's (https://learningally.org) College Success Program for blind and visually impaired students, I'm participating in a summer coding workshop on Python, learning how to program with it using assistive technology. This repository shows my completed assignments for this workshop.
